### Document review and publishing process (simplified)

- Team contact creates a new issue in the [WAI reviews and announcements GitHub repo](https://github.com/w3c/wai-reviews-and-announcements/issues), with a link to the review document that's ready for review
- Team contact lets Tamsin know date the document will be ready for review, and the estimated publication date
- Tamsin reviews the document and shares any suggested changes with the Team Contact
- Team Contact approves any changes
- Tamsin submits a Pull Request with the suggested changes (title of PR = [Doc title review]?)
- Team contact brings Tamsin's suggestions to the Editors for approval
- Team Contact shares the final updated document with Tamsin to do a quick last editorial check before publishing.
- Shawn/Remi approves for publishing

### Announcement process (simplified)
- Tamsin drafts the announcement blurbs for different channels
- Team Contact approves the announcement blurbs
- Shawn approves the announcement blurbs
- Tamsin shares the announcement blurbs with Comms 2 days before the announcement due date
- Tamsin/Shawn sends out the announcement via the different channels
